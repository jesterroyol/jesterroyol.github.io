        <h1>ABOUT USAIN BOLT (St. Leo Bolt)</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Usain St. Leo Bolt was born on August 21st, 1986 in Trelawny, Jamaica.
          He grew up loving and appreciating sports and was always thinking
          about them. In high school, he decided to shift his focus from cricket
          to track and field. He captured numerous championships, gold medals,
          and world records at the junior track and field level which caught the
          attention of the rest of the world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Usain Bolt's career is defined by his performances at the Olympics. At
          the Beijing 2008 Olympics, he broke his previous world best time in
          the 100m with a time of 9.69 seconds as well as broke the 200m world
          record with a time of 19.30 seconds. He is the only athlete to win the
          Olympic gold medal in the 100m and 200m sprints in three consecutive
          Olympic games..

        <br />
        <p>
          Usain Bolt currently holds the world records for men's 100m, 200m
          sprints and was part of the 4x100m world record-holding Jamaican
          quartet that included Nesta Carter, Michael Frater and Yohan Blake.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On August 16, 2009, under the lights of Berlin's Olympic Stadium at
          the World Championships, 22-year-old Usain Bolt strikes a
          lightning-bolt pose and grins before taking his mark. Then the
          Jamaican, already the fastest man in the world, shatters his own world
          record in the 100-meter dash, winning the event in 9.58 seconds. He
          becomes the first to run the event in less than 9.6 seconds.
